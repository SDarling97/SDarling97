# Hi there, I'm Sam 👋


I'm a 26-year-old Data Analyst from London, UK. I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Finance, where I spent two years studying in the US and completed my final year online. During my studies, I discovered a passion for data analysis and data science, particularly using Python. This interest led me to learn SQL and Power BI to further enhance my analytical skills.

I have a keen interest in working with large sales datasets, where I combine my finance and business background with data analysis to uncover what factors are affecting businesses—whether it's internal operations, economic influences, or a combination of both.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Languages:** Python (with Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Database Management:** SQL Server (intermediate to advanced queries)
