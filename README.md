# Hi there, I'm Sam 👋

I am 26 years old from London, UK. I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Finance, where I spent two years studying in the US and completed my final year online. During my final year, I began to dive into Python and discovered a deep interest in data analysis and data science! This interest led me to learn SQL and Power BI to further enhance my analytical and reporting skills.

I have a keen interest in working with large sales datasets, where I combine my finance and business background with data analysis to uncover what factors are affecting businesses—whether it's internal operations, economic influences, or a combination of both.

## 🎧🥊✈️ About Me

Outside of work, I enjoy a variety of activities:
- **Music**  I am a huge music fan spanning from heavy metal to country to bhangra to drum and bass! I like producing on Ableton as a hobby.
- **Exercise** Exercise is a huge part of my life whether it's lifting, running, or Muay Thai, it helps to keep my brain and body healthy!
- **Languages**  A few years ago, I randomly decided to learn Spanish, and it was one of the best decisions I ever made!
- **Travel** Like most people, I love to travel and escape England whenever possible. I have currently visited 27 countries, and my goal is to visit all 50 states of the US!
